# Binary Tree Node and Heap Insert

This folder contains the solutions for the tasks `0-binary_tree_node` and `1-heap_insert` in the Holberton School interview preparation project.

## Description

The tasks in this folder are related to binary tree nodes and heap insertion. The goal is to implement the necessary functions to create a binary tree node and insert elements into a binary heap.

## Files

- `0-binary_tree_node.c`: This file contains the implementation of the `binary_tree_node` function, which creates a new binary tree node.
- `1-heap_insert.c`: This file contains the implementation of the `heap_insert` function, which inserts a new element into a binary heap.
