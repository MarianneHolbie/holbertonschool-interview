This repository contains all the interview tasks that I have done in the Holberton School program.

## [lockboxes](lockboxes)

You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box 
may contain keys to the other boxes.
Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

## [insert_in_sorted_linked_list](insert_in_sorted_linked_list)

Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

## [heap_insert](heap_insert)

1. Write a function that creates a binary tree node
2. Write a function that inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap

## [log_parsing](log_parsing)
Write script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics

## [utf8_validation](./utf8_validation)
Write script to determine if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## [Menger](./menger)
Write a function that draws a 2D Menger Sponge

## [N queens](./nqueens)
The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

## [starwars_api](./starwars_api/)
 prints all characters of a Star Wars movie

## [heap sort](./heap_sort/)
Sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

## [advanced_binary_search](./advanced_binary_search/)
Instead of binary search, implement earch which return the index of the first value in the array (if this valuer appears more than once in the array)

## [rotate_2d_matrix](./rotate_2d_matrix/)
Given an image represented by an NxN matrix write a method to rotate it by 90 degrees.

## [making_change](./making_change)
Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount `total`.
